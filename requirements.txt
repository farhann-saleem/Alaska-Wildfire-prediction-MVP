# Core data handling and processing
rasterio                  # For reading and processing GeoTIFFs (we just used this) [cite: 639]
numpy                     # For numerical operations on image arrays [cite: 639]
pandas                    # For creating and managing the patch metadata CSV [cite: 721, 744]

# Machine Learning libraries (for Step 9 - Baseline Model)
torch   
tensorflow                  # PyTorch deep learning framework (often preferred) [cite: 367, 755]
# You can replace 'torch' with 'tensorflow' if that is your preference, but let's stick to PyTorch for now as a default
scikit-learn              # For basic metrics and model evaluation (e.g., F1-score, confusion matrix)
